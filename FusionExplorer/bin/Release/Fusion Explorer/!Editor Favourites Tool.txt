With the translation options, you need to select the field you want to set, with the combo box and set button, I did it this way because I wanted to precisely edit individual values for position and rotation (due to some precision stuff it would change values of other floats even if you didn't change anything)

Workflow for changing colors:
1. Refresh
2. Select Favourite
3. Select Object you want to change color of
4. Choose colors and click set color
5. Save Compressed as objectgroup.grp

if you're confused about anything, just ask me lol
